# Plot-Phase-Portraits-and-State-Space-Trajectories-of-Dynamical-Systems-in-MATLAB

In this tutorial, we explain how to generate phase portraits and state-space trajectories of dynamical systems in MATLAB. For example, consider the system 

For example, consider the following dynamical system: 

$$
\begin{equation}
\dot{x}_{1} =-x_{1}-3x_{2} \\
\dot{x}_{2} = 3x_{1} -x_{2}
\end{equation}
$$

In this tutorial, you will learn how to generate a phase portrait of this system. The phase portrait is shown in the figure below.
